Jewelery inventory management
============================

This is a command-line program meant for managing and tracking the number of items in a jewelery store. The user can enter in three kinds of jewelery (necklaces, bracelets, earrings), set the cost of each piece's materials and the amount of time worked on it, and place it into the store's inventory. The user may also view all the items in stock or sell (delete) them. This will be stored in an SQLite database.

The idea for this came from an old C++ program that I wrote years ago, as part of my one year of studying computer science in college.
